      "\n",
      "Under President Obama's leadership, and thanks to the hard work and determination of the American people, we have come a long way from the Great Recession and the Republican policies that triggered it. \n",

      "American businesses have now added 14.8 million jobs since private-sector job growth turned positive in early 2010. \n",
      "\n",
      "Twenty million people have gained health insurance coverage. \n",
      "\n",
      "The American auto industry just had its best year ever. \n",

      "And we are getting more of our energy from the sun and wind, and importing less oil from overseas. \n",
      "\n",
      "But too many Americans have been left out and left behind. \n",
      "\n",
      "They are working longer hours with less security. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wages have barely budged and the racial wealth gap remains wide, while the cost of everything from childcare to a college education has continued to rise. \n",
      "\n",
      "And for too many families, the dream of homeownership is out of reach. \n",
      "\n",
      "As working people struggle, the top one percent accrues more wealth and more power. \n",
      "\n",
      "Republicans in Congress have chosen gridlock and dysfunction over trying to find solutions to the real challenges we face. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's no wonder that so many feel like the system is rigged against them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats believe that cooperation is better than conflict, unity is better than division, empowerment is better than resentment, and bridges are better than walls. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's a simple but powerful idea: we are stronger together. \n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats believe we are stronger when we have an economy that works for everyone—an economy that grows incomes for working people, creates good-paying jobs, and puts a middle-class life within reach for more Americans. \n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats believe we can spur more sustainable economic growth, which will create good-paying jobs and raise wages. \n",
      "\n",
      "And we can have more economic fairness, so the rewards are shared broadly, not just with those at the top. \n",
      "\n",
      "We need an economy that prioritizes long-term investment over short-term profit-seeking, rewards the common interest over self-interest, and promotes innovation and entrepreneurship. \n",
      "\n",
      "We believe that today's extreme level of income and wealth inequality—where the majority of the economic gains go to the top one percent and the richest 20 people in our country own more wealth than the bottom 150 million—makes our economy weaker, our communities poorer, and our politics poisonous. \n",
      "\n",
      "And we know that our nation's long struggle with race is far from over. \n",
      "\n",
      "More than half a century after Rosa Parks sat and Dr. King marched and John Lewis bled, more than half a century after César Chávez, Dolores Huerta, and Larry Itliong organized, race still plays a significant role in determining who gets ahead in America and who gets left behind. \n",
      "\n",
      "We must face that reality and we must fix it. \n",
      "\n",
      "We believe a good education is a basic right of all Americans, no matter what zip code they live in. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will end the school-to-prison pipeline and build a cradle-to-college pipeline instead, where every child can live up to his or her God-given potential. \n",
      "\n",
      "We believe in helping Americans balance work and family without fear of punishment or penalty. \n",
      "\n",
      "We believe in at last guaranteeing equal pay for women. \n",
      "\n",
      "And as the party that created Social Security, we believe in protecting every American's right to retire with dignity. \n",
      "\n",
      "We firmly believe that the greed, recklessness, and illegal behavior on Wall Street must be brought to an end. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wall Street must never again be allowed to threaten families and businesses on Main Street. \n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats believe we are stronger when we protect citizens' right to vote, while stopping corporations' outsized influence in elections. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will fight to end the broken campaign finance system, overturn the disastrous Citizens United decision, restore the full power of the Voting Rights Act, and return control of our elections to the American people. \n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats believe that climate change poses a real and urgent threat to our economy, our national security, and our children's health and futures, and that Americans deserve the jobs and security that come from becoming the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. \n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats believe we are stronger and safer when America brings the world together and leads with principle and purpose. \n",
      "\n",
      "We believe we should strengthen our alliances, not weaken them. \n",
      "\n",
      "We believe in the power of development and diplomacy. \n",
      "\n",
      "We believe our military should be the best-trained, best-equipped fighting force in the world, and that we must do everything we can to honor and support our veterans. \n",
      "\n",
      "And we know that only the United States can mobilize common action on a truly global scale, to take on the challenges that transcend borders, from international terrorism to climate change to health pandemics. \n",
      "\n",
      "Above all, Democrats are the party of inclusion. \n",
      "\n",
      "We know that diversity is not our problem—it is our promise. \n",
      "\n",
      "As Democrats, we respect differences of perspective and belief, and pledge to work together to move this country forward, even when we disagree. \n",
      "\n",
      "With this platform, we do not merely seek common ground—we strive to reach higher ground. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are proud of our heritage as a nation of immigrants. \n",
      "\n",
      "We know that today's immigrants are tomorrow's teachers, doctors, lawyers, government leaders, soldiers, entrepreneurs, activists, PTA members, and pillars of our communities. \n",
      "\n",
      "We believe in protecting civil liberties and guaranteeing civil rights and voting rights, women's rights and workers' rights, LGBT rights, and rights for people with disabilities. \n",
      "\n",
      "We believe America is still, as Robert Kennedy said, \"a great country, an unselfish country, and a compassionate country.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "These principles stand in sharp contrast to the Republicans, who have nominated as the standard-bearer for their party and their candidate for President a man who seeks to appeal to Americans' basest differences, rather than our better natures. \n",
      "\n",
      "The stakes have been high in previous elections. \n",
      "\n",
      "But in 2016, the stakes can be measured in human lives—in the number of immigrants who would be torn from their homes; in the number of faithful and peaceful Muslims who would be barred from even visiting our shores; in the number of allies alienated and dictators courted; in the number of Americans who would lose access to health care and see their rights ripped away. \n",
      "\n",
      "This election is about more than Democrats and Republicans. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is about who we are as a nation, and who we will be in the future. \n",
      "\n",
      "Two hundred and forty years ago, in Philadelphia, we started a revolution of ideas and of action that continues to this day. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, our union has been tested many times, through bondage and civil war, segregation and depression, two world wars and the threat of nuclear annihilation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Generations of Americans fought and marched and organized to widen the circle of opportunity and dignity—and we are fighting still. \n",

      "Promoting Trade That is Fair and Benefits American WorkersDemocrats acknowledge that for millions of Americans, global trade has failed to live up to its promise—with too many countries breaking the rules and too many corporations outsourcing jobs at the expense of American workers and communities. \n",
      "\n",
      "Over the past three decades, America has signed too many trade deals that have not lived up to the hype. \n",

      "We need to end the race to the bottom and develop trade policies that support jobs in America. \n",
      "\n",
      "That is why Democrats believe we should review agreements negotiated years ago to update them to reflect these principles. \n",
      "\n",
      "Any future trade agreements must make sure our trading partners cannot undercut American workers by taking shortcuts on labor policy or the environment. \n",
      "\n",
      "They must not undermine democratic decision-making through special privileges and private courts for corporations, and trade negotiations must be transparent and inclusive. \n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats' priority is to significantly strengthen enforcement of existing trade rules and the tools we have, including by holding countries accountable on currency manipulation and significantly expanding enforcement resources. \n",
      "\n",
      "China and other countries are using unfair trade practices to tilt the playing field against American workers and businesses. \n",
      "\n",
      "When they dump cheap products into our markets, subsidize state-owned enterprises, devalue currencies, and discriminate against American companies, our middle class pays the price. \n",

      "That has to stop. \n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats will use all our trade enforcement tools to hold China and other trading partners accountable—because no country should be able to manipulate their currencies to gain a competitive advantage. \n",
      "\n",
      "While we believe that openness to the world economy is an important source of American leadership and dynamism, we will oppose trade agreements that do not support good American jobs, raise wages, and improve our national security. \n",

      "We believe any new trade agreements must include strong and enforceable labor and environmental standards in their core text with streamlined and effective enforcement mechanisms. \n",

      "Being stronger together means reaching communities that have been left out and left behind for too long, from coal country to Indian Country to neighborhoods held back by multigenerational poverty. \n",

      "Closing the Racial Wealth GapAmerica's economic inequality problem is even more pronounced when it comes to racial and ethnic disparities in wealth and income. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is unacceptable that the median wealth for African Americans and Latino Americans is roughly one-tenth that of white Americans. \n",
      "\n",
      "These disparities are also stark for American Indians and certain Asian American subgroups, and may become even more significant when considering other characteristics such as age, disability status, sexual orientation, or gender identity. \n",
      "\n",
      "The racial wealth and income gaps are the result of policies that discriminate against people of color and constrain their ability to earn income and build assets to the same extent as other Americans. \n",
      "\n",
      "It has accumulated over time and is made worse by ongoing policies and practices. \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, African Americans and Latinos lost more than half of their net worth as a result of the housing crisis and the Great Recession, because they lost jobs at a much faster rate than white workers and because they were disproportionately targeted for subprime, predatory, and fraudulent mortgages during the run-up to the housing crisis. \n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats believe it is long past time to close this racial wealth gap. \n",
      "\n",
      "Disparities in wealth cannot be solved by the free market alone, but instead, the federal government must play a role in eliminating systemic barriers to wealth accumulation for different racial groups and improving opportunities for people from all racial and ethnic backgrounds to build wealth. \n",
      "\n",
      "Federal policies must remove barriers to achieving sustainable homeownership, provide for greater diversity in federal and state contracting practices, incentivize and expand access to retirement investment programs, increase opportunities for quality jobs and education, and challenge the deeply rooted structures that perpetuate and exacerbate current disparities and ultimately stagnate the nation's economic growth and security. \n",
      "\n",
      "Reforming our Criminal Justice SystemDemocrats are committed to reforming our criminal justice system and ending mass incarceration. \n",
      "\n",
      "Something is profoundly wrong when almost a quarter of the world's prison population is in the United States, even though our country has less than five percent of the world's population. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will reform mandatory minimum sentences and close private prisons and detention centers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Research and evidence, rather than slogans and sound bites, must guide criminal justice policies. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will rebuild the bonds of trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. \n",
      "\n",
      "Across the country, there are police officers inspiring trust and confidence, honorably doing their duty, deploying creative and effective strategies, and demonstrating that it is possible to prevent crime without relying on unnecessary force. \n",
      "\n",
      "They deserve our respect and support, and we should learn from those examples and build on what works. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will work with police chiefs to invest in training for officers on issues such as de-escalation and the creation of national guidelines for the appropriate use of force. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will encourage better police-community relations, require the use of body cameras, and stop the use of weapons of war that have no place in our communities. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will end racial profiling that targets individuals solely on the basis of race, religion, ethnicity, or national origin, which is un-American and counterproductive. \n",
      "\n",
      "We should report national data on policing strategies and provide greater transparency and accountability. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will require the Department of Justice to investigate all questionable or suspicious police-involved shootings, and we will support states and localities who help make those investigations and prosecutions more transparent, including through reforming the grand jury process. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will assist states in providing a system of public defense that is adequately resourced and which meets American Bar Association standards. \n",
      "\n",
      "And we will reform the civil asset forfeiture system to protect people and remove perverse incentives for law enforcement to \"police for a profit.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of investing in more jails and incarceration, we need to invest more in jobs and education, and end the school-to-prison pipeline. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will remove barriers to help formerly incarcerated individuals successfully re-enter society by \"banning the box,\" expanding reentry programs, and restoring voting rights. \n",
      "\n",
      "We think the next President should take executive action to ban the box for federal employers and contractors, so applicants have an opportunity to demonstrate their qualifications before being asked about their criminal records. \n",
      "\n",
      "The \"war on drugs\" has led to the imprisonment of millions of Americans, disproportionately people of color, without reducing drug use. \n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever possible, Democrats will prioritize prevention and treatment over incarceration when tackling addiction and substance use disorder. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will build on effective models of drug courts, veterans' courts, and other diversionary programs that seek to give nonviolent offenders opportunities for rehabilitation as opposed to incarceration. \n",
      "\n",
      "Because of conflicting federal and state laws concerning marijuana, we encourage the federal government to remove marijuana from the list of \"Schedule 1\" federal controlled substances and to appropriately regulate it, providing a reasoned pathway for future legalization. \n",
      "\n",
      "We believe that the states should be laboratories of democracy on the issue of marijuana, and those states that want to decriminalize it or provide access to medical marijuana should be able to do so. \n",
      "\n",
      "We support policies that will allow more research on marijuana, as well as reforming our laws to allow legal marijuana businesses to exist without uncertainty. \n",
      "\n",
      "And we recognize our current marijuana laws have had an unacceptable disparate impact in terms of arrest rates for African Americans that far outstrip arrest rates for whites, despite similar usage rates. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will abolish the death penalty, which has proven to be a cruel and unusual form of punishment. \n",
      "\n",
      "It has no place in the United States of America. \n",
      "\n",
      "The application of the death penalty is arbitrary and unjust. \n",
      "\n",
      "The cost to taxpayers far exceeds those of life imprisonment. \n",
      "\n",
      "It does not deter crime. \n",
      "\n",
      "And, exonerations show a dangerous lack of reliability for what is an irreversible punishment. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have been inspired by the movements for criminal justice that directly address the discriminatory treatment of African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and American Indians to rebuild trust in the criminal justice system. \n",

      "Fixing our Broken Immigration SystemThe United States was founded as, and continues to be, a country of immigrants from throughout the world. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is no coincidence that the Statue of Liberty is one of our most profound national symbols. \n",
      "\n",
      "And that is why Democrats believe immigration is not just a problem to be solved, it is a defining aspect of the American character and our shared history. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Democratic Party supports legal immigration, within reasonable limits, that meets the needs of families, communities, and the economy as well as maintains the United States' role as a beacon of hope for people seeking safety, freedom, and security. \n",
      "\n",
      "People should come to the United States with visas and not through smugglers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, we recognize that the current immigration system is broken. \n",
      "\n",
      "More than 11 million people are living in the shadows, without proper documentation. \n",
      "\n",
      "The immigration bureaucracy is full of backlogs that result in U.S. citizens waiting for decades to be reunited with family members, and green card holders waiting for years to be reunited with their spouses and minor children. \n",
      "\n",
      "The current quota system discriminates against certain immigrants, including immigrants of color, and needs to be reformed to the realities of the 21st century. \n",
      "\n",
      "And there are real questions about our detention and deportation policies that must be addressed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats believe we need to urgently fix our broken immigration system—which tears families apart and keeps workers in the shadows—and create a path to citizenship for law-abiding families who are here, making a better life for their families and contributing to their communities and our country. \n",
      "\n",
      "We should repeal the 3-year, 10-year and permanent bars, which often force persons in mixed status families into the heartbreaking dilemma of either pursuing a green card by leaving the country and their loved ones behind, or remaining in the shadows. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will work with Congress to end the forced and prolonged expulsion from the country that these immigrants endure when trying to adjust their status. \n",
      "\n",
      "We must fix family backlogs and defend against those who would exclude or eliminate legal immigration avenues and denigrate immigrants. \n",
      "\n",
      "Those immigrants already living in the United States, who are assets to their communities and contribute so much to our country, should be incorporated completely into our society through legal processes that give meaning to our national motto: E Pluribus Unum. \n",
      "\n",
      "And while we continue to fight for comprehensive immigration reform, we will defend and implement President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans executive actions to help DREAMers, parents of citizens, and lawful permanent residents avoid deportation. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will build on these actions to provide relief for others, such as parents of DREAMers. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will support efforts by states to make DREAMers eligible for driver's licenses and in-state college tuition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will invest in culturally-appropriate immigrant integration services, expand access to English language education, and promote naturalization to help the millions of people who are eligible for citizenship take that last step. \n",
      "\n",
      "We believe immigration enforcement must be humane and consistent with our values. \n",
      "\n",
      "We should prioritize those who pose a threat to the safety of our communities, not hardworking families who are contributing to their communities. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will end raids and roundups of children and families, which unnecessarily sow fear in immigrant communities. \n",
      "\n",
      "We disfavor deportations of immigrants who served in our armed forces, and we want to create a faster path for such veterans to citizenship. \n",
      "\n",
      "We should ensure due process for those fleeing violence in Central America and work with our regional partners to address the root causes of violence. \n",
      "\n",
      "We must take particular care with children, which is why we should guarantee government-funded counsel for unaccompanied children in immigration courts. \n",
      "\n",
      "We should consider all available means of protecting these individuals from the threats to their lives and safety—including strengthening in-country and third-country processing, expanding the use of humanitarian parole, and granting Temporary Protected Status. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will promote best practices among local law enforcement, in terms of how they collaborate with federal authorities, to ensure that they maintain and build trust between local law enforcement and the communities they serve. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will also vigorously oversee any programs put in place, to make sure that there are no abuses and no arbitrary deportation programs. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will establish an affirmative process for workers to report labor violations and to request deferred action. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will work to ensure that all Americans—regardless of immigration status—have access to quality health care. \n",
      "\n",
      "That means expanding community health centers, allowing all families to buy into the Affordable Care Act exchanges, supporting states that open up their public health insurance programs to all persons, and finally enacting comprehensive immigration reform. \n",
      "\n",
      "And we will expand opportunities for DREAMers to serve in the military and to then receive expedited pathways to citizenship. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will fight to end federal, state, and municipal contracts with for-profit private prisons and private detention centers. \n",
      "\n",
      "In order to end family detention, we will ensure humane alternatives for those who pose no public threat. \n",
      "\n",
      "We recognize that there are vulnerable communities within our immigration system who are often seeking refuge from persecution abroad, such as LGBT families, for whom detention can be unacceptably dangerous. \n",
      "\n",
      "We reject attempts to impose a religious test to bar immigrants or refugees from entering the United States. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is un-American and runs counter to the founding principles of this country. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, Democrats will not stand for the divisive and derogatory language of Donald Trump. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "As the nation is grappling with how to expand educational access and increase success, especially for communities of color and low-income students and families, there is evidence that the nation's HBCUs and Minority Serving Institutions have honed promising models for educating these students to prepare them for high- and critical-need positions while containing costs. \n",

      "\n",
      "Cracking Down on Predatory For-Profit SchoolsWe will continue to crack down on for-profit schools that take millions in federal financial aid—often as their principal source of revenue—and then exploit students and burden them with debt rather than educating them. \n",

      "That is why we will strengthen the gainful employment rule to ensure that for-profit schools enable students to complete their degrees and prepare them for work. \n",

      "It is unacceptable that for-profit schools with low graduation rates keep encouraging their students to take out federal loans they will have trouble paying back. \n",

      "Thanks to the hard work of President Obama and Democrats in Congress, we took a critically important step toward the goal of universal health care by passing the Affordable Care Act, which has covered 20 million more Americans and ensured millions more will never be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats will never falter in our generations-long fight to guarantee health care as a fundamental right for every American. \n",
      "\n",
      "As part of that guarantee, Americans should be able to access public coverage through a public option, and those over 55 should be able to opt in to Medicare. \n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats will empower the states, which are the true laboratories of democracy, to use innovation waivers under the ACA to develop unique locally tailored approaches to health coverage. \n",
      "\n",
      "This will include removing barriers to states which seek to experiment with plans to ensure universal health care to every person in their state. \n",
      "\n",
      "By contrast, Donald Trump wants to repeal the ACA, leaving tens of millions of Americans without coverage. \n",
      "\n",
      "For too many of us, health care costs are still too high, even for those with insurance. \n",
      "\n",
      "And medical debt is a problem for far too many working families, with one-quarter of Americans reporting that they or someone in their household had problems or an inability to pay medical bills in the past year. \n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats will also work to end surprise billing and other practices that lead to out-of-control medical debt that place an unconscionable economic strain on American households. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will repeal the excise tax on high-cost health insurance and find revenue to offset it because we need to contain the long-term growth of health care costs, but should not risk passing on too much of the burden to workers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats will keep costs down by making premiums more affordable, reducing out-of-pocket expenses, and capping prescription drug costs. \n",
      "\n",
      "And we will fight against insurers trying to impose excessive premium increases. \n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats will fight any attempts by Republicans in Congress to privatize, voucherize, or \"phase out\" Medicare as we know it. \n",
      "\n",
      "And we will oppose Republican plans to slash funding and block grant Medicaid and SNAP, which would harm millions of Americans. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will keep fighting until the ACA's Medicaid expansion has been adopted in every state. \n",
      "\n",
      "Nineteen states have not yet expanded Medicaid. \n",
      "\n",
      "This means that millions of low-income Americans still lack health insurance and are not getting the care they need. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, health care providers, clinics, hospitals, and taxpayers are footing a higher bill when people without insurance visit expensive emergency rooms. \n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats believe your zip code or census tract should not be a predictor of your health, which is why we will make health equity a central part of our commitment to revitalizing communities left behind. \n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats believe that all health care services should be culturally and linguistically appropriate, and that neither fear nor immigration status should be barriers that impede health care access. \n",
      "\n",
      "Supporting Community Health CentersWe must renew and expand our commitment to Community Health Centers, as well as community mental health centers and family planning centers. \n",
      "\n",
      "These health centers provide critically important, community-based prevention and treatment in underserved communities, prevent unnecessary and expensive trips to emergency rooms, and are essential to the successful implementation of the ACA. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will fight for a comprehensive system of primary health care, including dental, mental health care, and low-cost prescription drugs by doubling of funding for federally qualified community health centers over the next decade, which currently serve 25 million people. \n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats also know that one of the key ingredients to the success of these health centers is a well-supported and qualified workforce in community-based settings. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will fight to train and support this workforce, encourage providers to work with underserved populations through the National Health Service Corps, and create a comprehensive strategy to increase the pool of primary health care professionals. \n",
      "\n",
      "Reducing Prescription Drug CostsIt is unacceptable that the United States pays, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and that too many Americans between the ages of 18 and 64 cannot afford to fill their prescriptions. \n",
      "\n",
      "A lifesaving drug is no good if it is unaffordable to the very people who need it most. \n",
      "\n",
      "And many drug companies are spending more on advertising than on research. \n",
      "\n",
      "The largest pharmaceutical companies are making billions of dollars per year in profits at higher margins compared to other industries while many stash their profits in offshore tax havens. \n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, they charge Americans thousands of dollars for new drugs—often at much higher costs than in other developed nations. \n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats are committed to investing in the research, development, and innovation that creates lifesaving drugs and lowers overall health costs, but the profiteering of pharmaceutical companies is simply unacceptable. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will crack down on price gouging by drug companies and cap the amount Americans have to pay out-of-pocket every month on prescription drugs. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will prohibit anti-competitive \"pay for delay\" deals that keep generic drugs off the market, and we will allow individuals, pharmacists, and wholesalers to import prescription drugs from licensed pharmacies in Canada and other countries with appropriate safety protections. \n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats will also fight to make sure that Medicare will negotiate lower prices with drug manufacturers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Enabling Cutting-Edge Medical ResearchDemocrats believe we must accelerate the pace of medical progress, ensuring that we invest more in our scientists and give them the resources they need to invigorate our fundamental studies in the life sciences in a growing, stable, and predictable way. \n",
      "\n",
      "We must make progress against the full range of diseases, including Alzheimer's, HIV and AIDS, cancer, and other diseases, especially chronic ones. \n",
      "\n",
      "We recognize the critical importance of a fully-funded National Institutes of Health to accelerate the pace of medical progress. \n",
      "\n",
      "Combating Drug and Alcohol AddictionWe must confront the epidemic of drug and alcohol addiction, specifically the opioid crisis and other drugs plaguing our communities, by vastly expanding access to prevention and treatment, supporting recovery, helping community organizations, and promoting better practices by prescribers. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Democratic Party is committed to assisting the estimated 20 million people struggling with addiction in this country to find and sustain healthy lives by encouraging full recovery and integration into society and working to remove common barriers to gainful employment, housing, and education. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will continue to fight to expand access to care for addiction services, and ensure that insurance coverage is equal to that for any other health conditions. \n",
      "\n",
      "We think it is time for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Labor, and state regulatory agencies to fully implement the protections of the Mental Health Parity and Addictions Equity Act of 2008—which means that American medical insurers, including the federal government, will need to disclose how they make their medical management decisions. \n",
      "\n",
      "We should also do more to educate our youth, as well as their families, teachers, coaches, mentors, and friends, to intervene early to prevent drug and alcohol abuse and addiction. \n",
      "\n",
      "We should help state and local leaders establish evidence-based, age-appropriate, and locally-tailored prevention programs. \n",
      "\n",
      "These programs include school-based drug education programs that have been shown to have meaningful effects on risky behavior; community-based peer mentorship and leadership programs; and after-school activities that deter drug use and encourage life skills. \n",
      "\n",
      "Treating Mental HealthWe must treat mental health issues with the same care and seriousness that we treat issues of physical health, support a robust mental health workforce, and promote better integration of the behavioral and general health care systems. \n",
      "\n",
      "Recognizing that maintaining good mental health is critical to all people, including young people's health and development, we will work with health professionals to ensure that all children have access to mental health care. \n",
      "\n",
      "We must also expand community-based treatment for substance abuse disorders and mental health conditions and fully enforce our parity law. \n",
      "\n",
      "And we should create a national initiative around suicide prevention across the lifespan—to move toward the HHS-promoted Zero Suicide commitment. \n",
      "\n",
      "Supporting Those Living with Autism and their FamiliesDemocrats believe that our country must make supporting the millions of individuals with autism and those diagnosed in the future and their families a priority. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will conduct a nationwide early screening outreach campaign to ensure that all children, and in particular children from underserved backgrounds, can get screened for autism. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will expand services and support for adults and individuals transitioning into adulthood, including employment and housing assistance. \n",
      "\n",
      "And we will push states to require health insurance coverage for autism services in private insurance plans as well as state marketplaces so that people with autism are not denied care. \n",
      "\n",
      "Securing Reproductive Health, Rights, and JusticeDemocrats are committed to protecting and advancing reproductive health, rights, and justice. \n",
      "\n",
      "We believe unequivocally, like the majority of Americans, that every woman should have access to quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion—regardless of where she lives, how much money she makes, or how she is insured. \n",
      "\n",
      "We believe that reproductive health is core to women's, men's, and young people's health and wellbeing. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will continue to stand up to Republican efforts to defund Planned Parenthood health centers, which provide critical health services to millions of people. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will continue to oppose—and seek to overturn—federal and state laws and policies that impede a woman's access to abortion, including by repealing the Hyde Amendment. \n",
      "\n",
      "We condemn and will combat any acts of violence, harassment, and intimidation of reproductive health providers, patients, and staff. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will defend the ACA, which extends affordable preventive health care to women, including no-cost contraception, and prohibits discrimination in health care based on gender. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will address the discrimination and barriers that inhibit meaningful access to reproductive health care services, including those based on gender, sexuality, race, income, disability, and other factors. \n",
      "\n",
      "We recognize that quality, affordable comprehensive health care, evidence-based sex education and a full range of family planning services help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions. \n",
      "\n",
      "And we strongly and unequivocally support a woman's decision to have a child, including by ensuring a safe and healthy pregnancy and childbirth, and by providing services during pregnancy and after the birth of a child, including adoption and social support services, as well as protections for women against pregnancy discrimination. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are committed to creating a society where children are safe and can thrive physically, emotionally, educationally, and spiritually. \n",
      "\n",
      "We recognize and support the importance of civil structures that are essential to creating this for every child. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ensuring Long-Term Care, Services, and SupportsOur country faces a long-term care crisis that prevents too many seniors and people with disabilities from being able to live with dignity at home or in their communities. \n",
      "\n",
      "The vast majority of people who are aging or living with a disability want to do so at home, but face challenges finding and affording the support they need to do so. \n",
      "\n",
      "Programs that emphasize independence rather than institutionalization must be better structured to support them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats will take steps to strengthen and expand the home care workforce, give seniors and people with disabilities access to quality, affordable long-term care, services, and supports, and ensure that all of these resources are readily available at home or in the community. \n",
      "\n",
      "Protecting and Promoting Public HealthInvestment in our nation's crumbling public health infrastructure is critical to ensuring preparedness for emerging threats; for preventing disease, illness, and injury in communities; and for promoting good health and wellbeing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Inadequate access to public health services has a disparate impact on poor, rural, and minority communities where public health services are a significant source of health care. \n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats will fight for increased investments in public health to better address emerging threats and the needs across our country. \n",
      "\n",
      "To further that end, the Democratic Party will continue to oppose Republican attempts to cut public health services and funding. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will ensure adequate funding of public health education at the undergraduate, graduate, and medical school levels as well as adequate funding of residency training programs in public health, preventive medicine, and its subspecialties. \n",
      "\n",
      "We must take a number of proactive steps so that all Americans—regardless of location, income or history—have the opportunity to live full, healthy lives. \n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats will fight for increased investments and coordination in public health to better address emerging threats as well as persistent needs across our country. \n",
      "\n",
      "Health equity among Americans remains elusive—higher income is strongly associated with longer life expectancy and the gap in life expectancy between the richest and poorest Americans is increasing. \n",
      "\n",
      "We continue to see unacceptable differences in health outcomes by race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation. \n",
      "\n",
      "A growing body of research demonstrates the link between social factors—such as poverty, unemployment, experience of discrimination, and housing instability—and poor health. \n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats will continue to pursue policies addressing these social factors and empowering communities to respond to their most pressing health needs. \n",

      "Ending Violence Against WomenDemocrats are committed to ending the scourge of violence against women wherever it occurs —whether in our homes, streets, schools, military, or elsewhere. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will continue to support the Violence Against Women Act to provide law enforcement with the tools it needs to combat this problem. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will support comprehensive services for survivors of violence and increase prevention efforts in our communities and on our campuses. \n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats will fight to bring an end to sexual assault—wherever it occurs, including on campuses— because everyone deserves a safe environment where they can learn and thrive, not live in fear. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will provide comprehensive support to survivors, and ensure a fair process for all on-campus disciplinary proceedings and in the criminal justice system. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will increase sexual violence prevention education programs that cover issues like consent and bystander intervention, not only in college, but also in secondary school. \n",
      "\n",
      "Preventing Gun ViolenceWith 33,000 Americans dying every year, Democrats believe that we must finally take sensible action to address gun violence. \n",
      "\n",
      "While responsible gun ownership is part of the fabric of many communities, too many families in America have suffered from gun violence. \n",
      "\n",
      "We can respect the rights of responsible gun owners while keeping our communities safe. \n",
      "\n",
      "To build on the success of the lifesaving Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, we will expand and strengthen background checks and close dangerous loopholes in our current laws; repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) to revoke the dangerous legal immunity protections gun makers and sellers now enjoy; and keep weapons of war—such as assault weapons and large capacity ammunition magazines (LCAM's)—off our streets. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will fight back against attempts to make it harder for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to revoke federal licenses from law breaking gun dealers, and ensure guns do not fall into the hands of terrorists, intimate partner abusers, other violent criminals, and those with severe mental health issues. \n",
      "\n",
      "There is insufficient research on effective gun prevention policies, which is why the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must have the resources it needs to study gun violence as a public health issue. \n",

      "We believe the smart use of diplomacy, development, and economic statecraft can prevent crises, foster stability, and make us safer. \n",

      "And we believe that we are stronger when we work with our partners and allies, rather than try to go it alone. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our global network of alliances is not a burden—it is a source of tremendous strategic advantage. \n",
      "\n",
      "We believe that while our military must be the strongest in the world, it should only be sent into combat when the terms of engagement are clearly presented to the American people and our troops have what they need to fulfill their mission. \n",

      "We believe that war must always be the last resort, never the first choice. \n",
      "\n",
      "These principles have underpinned important progress in the last eight years. \n",
      "\n",
      "When President Obama and Vice President Biden assumed office, the world economy was in the worst crisis since the Great Depression, our alliances were strained, Osama bin Laden remained at large, Iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon, and we were mired in two costly wars. \n",
      "\n",
      "We brought bin Laden to justice, crippled al Qaeda's core leadership, saved America from a second Great Depression, repaired our alliances, reestablished relations with Cuba while pressing for reforms, and—without firing a shot, dropping a bomb, or putting a single American soldier in harm's way—blocked Iran's ability to pursue a nuclear weapon. \n",
      "\n",
      "America is stronger abroad and safer at home because of this principled leadership. \n",
